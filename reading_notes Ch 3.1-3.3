# Oscillatory Motion and Chaos
In this chapter the focus is on oscillatory phenomena, in particular the effects that occur in a real oscillatory system (considering friction and a 
reasonable angle, such as the movement is not considered simple harmonic motion. The simplest one is a pendulum (mass connected by a string to a support, 
able to swing freely in response to the force of gravity. 

## Simple harmonic motion (3.1)
Object of interest: Simple pendulum (particle of mass m connected by a massless string to a rigid support). 

### Analytic solution
θ is the angle that the strings makes with 
the vertical. Two forces (parallel and perp to the string) are acting on the particle, gravity and tension of the string. 
Net parallel force = 0
Net perpendicular force = -mgsin(θ) --> This force is equal to (newton 2 law) mass times acceleration of particle along the particle's trajectory 
(arc = Fθ = md^2/dt). The displacement along this arc is s = lθ, where l is the lenght of the string. If we assume that θ is so small that sinθ = θ we 
obtain d^2θ/ dt^2 = -(g/l)*θ  --> Which is the central equation of simple harmonic motion.
According to this solution the oscillations are sinusoidal and continue forever without decaying.

## Numerical approach
Letting θi and wi be the numerical approximated angular displacement and velocity of the pendulum at time step i:
This is the pseudocode for euler_calculate:
For each time step i calculate w and θ at time step i+1
  wi+1 = wi -(g/l)θi*Δt
  θi+1 = θi + wi*Δt
  ti+1 = ti + Δt
  Repeat for desired number of time steps

The result of this will be an oscillatory motion with the amplitude that grows with time. This is contrary to the exact solution.
The problem is in the energy that increases with time, but since the problem has no source of energy or friction the energy should remain constant

## Correct numerical approach
To find the correct answer we should use the Euler-Cromer method:
For each time step i calculate w and θ at time step i+1
  wi+1 = wi - (g/l)θi*Δt
  θi+1 = θi+wi+1*Δt
  ti+1 = ti + Δt
  Repeat for desired numer of time steps

With this method the previous values of w and θ are usef to calulate the new value of w, but the new value of w is used to calulate the new value of θ
