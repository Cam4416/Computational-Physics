# Chapter 1

Before writing any code, construct an outline of how the problem 
is to be solved and what variables/parameters will be needed.

## Overall structure of the program:
1) declare necessary variables
2) initialize all variables and parameters --> set the initial values of the variales
3) do the calculation --> i.e. with the Euler method
4) store the results
5) graph for a better understanding

## Testing your program:
1) Have a rough idea of what the result should be like and decide whether or not is consistent with the code output.  
2) Compare the code's output with the analytic solution (if available)
3) Check that the program gives the same answer for different step sizes

##Programming guidelines:
1) Use subroutines to organize the major tasks
2) Use descriptive names for variables
3) Use comment statements
4) If needed use more lines/variables to make the code more understandable
5) Make the code look as much as possible like the physics equation
